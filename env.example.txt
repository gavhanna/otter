# Server Configuration
PORT=3001
HOST=0.0.0.0

# Database URL (SQLite example for Prisma)
# Prisma expects the SQLite file to be relative to the schema.prisma file, or an absolute path.
# For a typical setup where schema.prisma is in apps/server/prisma, this would be:
DATABASE_URL="file:../data/otter.db" 
# If schema.prisma is at the root of apps/server, then:
# DATABASE_URL="file:./data/otter.db" 
# Ensure the ./data directory is correctly mapped in Docker.

# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET="your-super-secret-jwt-key-please-change"
JWT_EXPIRES_IN="7d"

# Admin User (username of the first admin)
ADMIN_USERNAME="admin"

# Data Storage Paths (relative to the server's execution directory)
# These will be used by the application logic directly.
# Ensure these paths are writable by the server process.
AUDIO_STORAGE_PATH="./data/audio_files"
# The actual SQLite DB path is configured via DATABASE_URL for Prisma.
# SQLITE_DB_PATH="./data/otter.db" # This is just a note, Prisma uses DATABASE_URL

# Whisper Model Configuration (example, adjust as needed)
# WHISPER_MODEL_PATH="./models/ggml-base.en.bin"
# WHISPER_THREADS=4

# Frontend URL (for CORS or other settings if needed)
# FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
